## Palindrome Report

To mix things up a little bit, I parsed through `words.txt` in a python script, which outputs a texts file called `palindromes.txt` which contains all of the words in `words.txt` that are palindromes that are longer than one letter. A palindrome is a word that is the same backwards as forwards, e.g. "Anna" spelled backwards is "Anna".

We can now read in the palindromes and print them out here in an RMarkdown report.

```{r print palindromes}
knitr::kable(read.delim("palindromes.txt"), col.names="Palindromes")
```
